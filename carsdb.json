    "description": "In terms of what's under the hood, Ford is going with an all-forced-induction engine lineup; there are no naturally aspirated options. The base engine is the 2.3-liter turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder borrowed from the Ranger, and Ford estimates it will put out 270 hp and 310 lb-ft. (For those keeping score, that's the same horsepower as the Wrangler's optional 2.0-liter turbo, but with a smidge more torque.) If you put premium fuel in the thank, power rises to 300 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. ",
